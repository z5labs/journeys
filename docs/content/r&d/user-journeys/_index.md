This section contains user journey documentation that defines how users interact with the journey tracking system. Each user journey includes:

- Flow diagrams showing the user's path through the system
- Technical requirements categorized by priority (P0/P1/P2)
- Success metrics for measuring journey effectiveness
- Related documentation and references

User journeys help bridge the gap between user needs and technical implementation, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of how features should work from both a user and technical perspective.
